# Rice Image Generation Plan

## Basmati 1509 Series (Needs to be distinct from 1121)
**Visual Target:** Slightly shorter grain length compared to 1121, but thicker/fatter width.
*   **1509 Steam:** "Macro photography of uncooked 1509 Steam Basmati rice. The grains are long but visibly thicker and slightly shorter than 1121. Creamy white, translucent steam texture. High realism."
*   **1509 White Sella:** "Macro photography of uncooked 1509 White Sella Basmati. Thick, long grains with a creamy sella finish. Distinctly broader girth than the slender 1121. Realistic texture."
*   **1509 Golden Sella:** "Macro photography of uncooked 1509 Golden Sella Basmati. Thick, robust long grains with a deep golden amber color. Broader shape than 1121. Realistic studio lighting."

## Basmati 1401 Series (Needs to be distinct from 1121/1509)
**Visual Target:** Aromatic but slightly stouter; Raw version is very chalky.
*   **1401 Steam:** "Macro photography of uncooked 1401 Steam Basmati. Long grains, slightly off-white, distinct steam texture. High realism."
*   **1401 Raw:** (Already have a good raw proxy, but can refine) "Macro photography of raw 1401 Basmati. Chalky white, opaque centers, slender but substantial grains."

## Other Specialized Varieties
